# HypeCAS

  HypeCAS is a personal project of mine. The eventual goal of the project is to create a fully functioning general-purpose computer algebra system.

Current functionality of HypeCAS:
  - Polynomial interpreter. Converts a given polynomial into an array that contains 1x2 arrays formatted as [coefficient, exponent].
  - Convert coefficient-exponent arrays to standard polynomial form.
  - Combination of like terms.
  - Polynomial addition.
