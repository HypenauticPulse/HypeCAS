# HypeCAS

  HypeCAS is a personal project of mine. The eventual goal of the project is to create a fully functioning general-purpose computer algebra system.

Current functionality of HypeCAS:
  - Semi-functioning polynomial converter. The goal is to convert a given polynomial into an array that contains 1x2 arrays formatted as [coefficient, exponent]. The issue currently is distinguishing between linear terms and constant terms.
